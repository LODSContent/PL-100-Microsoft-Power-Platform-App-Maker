    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](03/media/Lab3-Ex6-step17.png)

18.  On the **Review** screen, verify that your problem report resembles, the
    image below:

19.  Select **Create.**
    
    > **NOTE**
    >
    > It can take a few minutes for your new app to be created.

20.  Your newly created app will resemble the image below:

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](03/media/Lab3-Ex6-step20.png)

    When you create an app from an image, you are somewhat limited as to the types
    of fields that you can select. For this reason, some items such as lookup fields
    will not display properly since the data type was defined as text. For this
    reason, we will make some modifications to the application to fix this.

    Both the Department and Building field are lookup fields. We are going to remove
    the generated ones and replace them with the actual fields from Dataverse.

21.  On the left side of your app screen, select the **Form1** control.

22.  In the **Properties** section on the right of the screen, select **Edit
    Fields.**

23.  Hover the **Building_DataCardXXX (Custom)** field and **Remove** it.

24.  Hover the **Department_DataCardXXX (Custom)** field and **Remove** it as
    well.

    Next, we are going to add the actual Lookup field from Dataverse to the app.

25.  Select **Add Fields.**

26.  From the menu that appears, select the **Building** and **Department**
    fields.

    Next, we are going to make some formatting changes to ensure that all the
    Data Cards on the form look the same.

27.  Using the **Sizing controls** on **Form1**, make the form bigger so that the
    **Department** field displays.

28.  In the **Fields** menu to the left of the actual Canvas App screen, move the
    **Building** field below the **Name** field.

29.  Move the **Department** field below the **Building** field.

30. On **Form1**, Select the **Label** control on the **Details** Data Card.

31. Change the **Font** to **21** and the **Font Weight** to **Semibold**.

32. Repeat that process for the **Status**, **Resolved On** and **Resolution**
    Data Cards.

33. On **Form1** in Tree View, select the **Name_DataCardXXX (Custom)** control

34. Using the **Sizing** controls, change the **Height** of the control to about
    142.

35. Move the **Name** Data Card‚Äôs, **Textinput** control to the bottom of the
    control, and expand the controls width so that it is the same width of the
    other controls on the form.

36. Move the controls **TextLabel** to align with the other labels on the form.

37. Change the **Name Label Font** to **21** and the **Font Weight** to
    **Semibold**.

38. If necessary, resize the **Form** control to ensure that the **Resolution**
    field is completely displayed.

39. Your completed App should resemble the Image below.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](03/media/Lab3-Ex6-step39.png)
